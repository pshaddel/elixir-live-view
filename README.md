# LiveView Studio
This is a practice from [pragmaticstudio](https://github.com/pragmaticstudio) and I tried to commit my excercise here. 

## Installation

1. Set up the project:

    ```sh
    mix setup
    ```

2. Fire up the Phoenix endpoint:

    ```sh
    mix phx.server
    ```

3. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## App Generation

This app was generated using:

```sh
mix phx.new live_view_studio --live
```
